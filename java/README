Java VNC Viewer Source Distribution
===================================

VNC is Copyright Olivetti & Oracle Research Laboratory.  This software is
distributed under the GNU General Public Licence as published by the Free
Software Foundation.  See the file LICENCE.TXT for the conditions under

sources.  See the Acknowledgements section below, and the individual files
for details of the conditions under which they are made available.


Simply do a "make" to compile all the .java files to .class files.  This will
also generate a JAR (Java archive) file containing all the classes.  Copy all
the .class files and the .jar file to an installation directory
(e.g. /usr/local/vnc/classes) and make sure that the vncserver script is
configured to point to that directory.
